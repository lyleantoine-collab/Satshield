# SatShield: First Nations-led Satellite Encryption Relay

*A Raspberry Pi 5 Solution for Secure Remote Comms*

## Overview  
First Nations-led SatShield.  

A Raspberry Pi 5 relay that stops recent satellite data leaks—no more open comms.  

Plugs between router and dish for AES-256 encryption. Zero cloud dependency.  

Uses Pi 5's GPIO for traffic relay, OpenSSL for on-device AES-256.  

We're seeking **$16,000** for a 90-day prototype sprint to secure encrypted satellite comms for remote communities.  

## Outcomes  
- Secure, encrypted satellite comms for remote communities.  
- Scalable $1,000/unit product—breaks even on the 16th sale.  
- Projected Revenue: $16,000 in Year 1 (16 units sold).  
- Indigenous-led. Local. Affordable. Deployable now.  

Retained assets: Rugged laptop and USB hub.  

## Funding Breakdown ($16k Sprint)  
- **$5k**: Hardware (3 Raspberry Pi 5s, Arctic case, rugged laptop, USB hub).  
- **$5k**: Incorporation + provisional patents (CA/US).  
- **$6k**: 90-day focused build (firmware, testing – one full-time dev role equivalent).  

## The Problem  
Recent uni hacks (UCSD/UMD, Oct 2025) exposed unencrypted satellite feeds—Starlink/Iridium signals leak location/data in remote areas, risking Indigenous privacy and sovereignty.  

Northern communities (Labrador, NWT) need reliable, private connectivity without big-telco dependencies or central databases. Current solutions? Costly overhauls or vulnerable pipes.  

## The Solution  
SatShield is a palm-sized, rugged modem that intercepts satellite signals at the dish, encrypts them on-device (AES-256 + quantum-resistant keys), and outputs to any existing router/device.  

- **Plug-and-Play**: Backward-compatible—no rip/replace hardware.  
- **Arctic-Proof**: -40°C rated, solar-optional power for off-grid.  
- **Sovereign-First**: User-owned keys, no cloud handoff; on-chain logging for audits.  

## Tech Specs  
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 base (3-unit cluster for redundancy), USB satellite adapter, custom firmware.  
- Encryption: End-to-end, zero-knowledge proofs for metadata.  
- Cost: $500/unit at scale; prototype sprint: $16k total.  
- Roadmap: Q1 2026 beta for Mi'kmaq/Labrador pilots.

## Impact & Savings  
- Empowers remote bands with fraud-proof data control—ties to reconciliation treaties.  
- Vs. alternatives: 70% cheaper than enterprise VPNs, 100% privacy edge.
