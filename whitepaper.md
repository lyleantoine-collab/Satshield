First Nations-led SatShield

A Raspberry Pi 5 relay that stops last week's satellite data leaks—no more open comms.

Plugs between router and dish for AES-256 encryption. Zero cloud dependency.

Uses Pi 5's GPIO for traffic relay, OpenSSL for on-device AES-256.

We're seeking $40,000 to acquire:

50 Raspberry Pi 5s

Firmware flasher kit

Rugged laptop

USB hub

Plus: One full-time developer and one First Nations summer student (STEM roles)

Outcomes:

Secure, encrypted satellite comms for remote communities

Two new STEM jobs: One full-time tech role, one First Nations summer student

Retained assets: Rugged laptop and USB hub

Scalable $1,000/unit product—breaks even and turns profit on the 40th sale

Projected Revenue:

$40,000 in Year 1 (40 units sold).

Indigenous-led. Local. Affordable. Deployable now.
