First Nations-led SatShield: 
Raspberry Pi five relay that stops last week's satellite data leaks-no more open comms. 
Plug between router and dish, AES-two-fifty-six encryption, zero cloud. 

We're asking forty thousand to get: 
fifty Pi fives, flasher kit, rugged laptop, USB hub-plus one full-time dev and one summer student.

Result: 
secure comms, two new STEM jobs-one tech, one First Nations summer student-rugged laptop, USB hub, and a $1,000 unit that turns profit on sale forty. 

Revenue: 
forty grand year one. 

Indigenous, local, cheap, done.
